    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Soft bread</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Ground Pork</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a baking sheet with tin foil — optional but helps with clean up!</li>
        <li>Tear bread into small pieces and place in a food processor (a blender may work). Process until the bread is in fine crumbs and combine with water. Stir and let sit for a few minutes. (*If you do not have a food processor, you may also mash the bread with the water until it is in fine crumbs).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine beef, pork, cheese, eggs, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and soaked bread until just combined — don't overmix!</li>
        <li>Shape into 1.5-2" balls (I get about 40 this way, but you can get up to 60 if you shape them into 1" balls) and place 1" apart on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes (longer for 2" rounds, shorter for 1" rounds), until a meat thermometer reads at least 160 degrees F in the largest meatballs (a meat thermometer is your best chance at having perfectly cooked meatballs!)</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Add to your favorite sauce, or let cool for 20-30 minutes before placing in a freezer safe bag or container and storing in the fridge or freezer.</li>
    </ol>
