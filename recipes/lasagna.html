    <p><h1>Prep Work</h1></p>
    <p><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</p>
    <p><h1>Make the Meat Sauce</h1></p>
    <p>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</p>
    <p>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it is very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</p>
    <p>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</p>
