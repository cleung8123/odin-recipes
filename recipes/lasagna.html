    <ul>

        <li>Onion and garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato products</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    <li>
        Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>

    <li>
        Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it is very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>

    <li>
        Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>

    <li>
        Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</li>
    </ol>
